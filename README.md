## üìñ **Overview**
Auditing workflows often involve repetitive and time-consuming tasks that require more manual effort than creative thinking. As an auditor, I faced this challenge while creating detailed monthly reports for six branches. Instead of just accepting the inefficiency, I took it as an opportunity to create a solution that not only saved me time but also generated revenue by helping others.  

### **What makes this special?**  
- It‚Äôs not just about coding‚Äîit‚Äôs about solving **real-world problems**.  
- The solution wasn‚Äôt written from scratch but was built collaboratively with ChatGPT.  
- It‚Äôs a system so effective that others are willing to pay for it!  

Today, I can complete in **one day** what previously took **seven working days**. Better yet, this project has generated **‚Çπ25,000 in revenue** by automating workflows for other auditors.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Problem Statement**
Creating audit reports for six branches required processing upto 450 `.txt` files per branch, totaling upto **2,700 `.txt` files each month**. The process involved:  
- Manually cleaning raw data from `.txt` files.  
- Formatting and organizing data into Excel.  
- Transferring the formatted data into Word templates for final reporting.  

This repetitive, labor-intensive task left little room for creative or strategic thinking.

## üö© **Challenges**
1. **High Volume**: Processing upto **2,700 `.txt` files monthly** for six branches was overwhelming.  
2. **Repetition**: The same steps‚Äîclean, format, transfer‚Äîhad to be repeated for all 15 annexures.  
3. **Time-Consuming**: Completing reports for six branches required **seven working days**.  
4. **Error-Prone**: Manual processing increased the risk of errors in critical reports.  

---

## üí° **Solution**
I created a **Python-based automation system** that simplifies and accelerates the entire workflow.  

### Key Components:
1. **Data Extraction**: Reads raw `.txt` files and extracts relevant data.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Formatting**: Applies predefined logic to clean and organize data.  
3. **Report Generation**: Outputs formatted Excel files ready for final reporting.  

All these processes are executed by a single script, `start.py`, making the workflow seamless and efficient.

## üîÑ **Workflow**
### **Before Automation**
1. Download `.txt` files for all 15 annexures (Max 450 per branch).  
2. Clean and process each file manually.  
3. Format cleaned data into Excel.  
4. Transfer data into Word report templates.  

### **After Automation**
1. Use the `start.py` script to process all `.txt` files.  
2. The script automatically:  
   - Extracts, cleans, and formats data for all annexures.  
   - Organizes data into structured Excel files.  
3. Copy the final data from Excel to Word templates for reporting.

## ‚ú® **Features**
- **Time-Saving**: Reduced report creation time from **7 days to 1 day**.  
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Automated cleaning and formatting minimize errors.  
- **Scalability**: Handles reports for multiple branches effortlessly.  
- **Customizable**: Logic can be adapted to different annexures or workflows.

## üìà **Impact**
### **Personal Productivity**
- Freed up six days each month for more strategic and creative work.  
- Improved accuracy and consistency in reports.  

### **Entrepreneurial Success**
- Recognized the value of this solution to others.  
- Began offering report generation services for other auditors:  
  - **‚Çπ2,000 for 5 branches (monthly report)**.  
  - **‚Çπ1,500 for Excel preparation (cleaned and formatted data)**.  
- Generated **‚Çπ25,000 in revenue** to date, with ongoing demand from peers.

## üìÅ **Project Files**
- **Python Scripts**:
  - `actvmerge.py`: Extracts relevant data from `.txt` files based on predefined logic.  
  - `exclACTV.py`: Cleans, formats, and organizes data into structured Excel files.  
  - `start.py`: Executes the entire workflow in sequence.  

- **Sample Data**:  
  Includes fake, representative data to demonstrate functionality (real data cannot be shared due to confidentiality).

## üöÄ **How to Use**
1. Clone the repository to your local system.  
2. Place `.txt` files in the specified input folder.  
3. Run `start.py`:
   ```bash
   python start.py
4. Follow the step that code says after running.
5. Do some manual task if required .

## üåü **Why This Matters**
This project demonstrates that automation is not just about saving time‚Äîit‚Äôs about transforming workflows, improving accuracy, and creating value. It highlights my ability to:

- Identify inefficiencies in everyday tasks.
- Build practical solutions that solve real problems.
- Turn a solution into a service others are willing to pay for.

## üéØ **Conclusion**
This project exemplifies my approach to problem-solving:
1. **Identify Inefficiencies**: Recognize repetitive and time-consuming tasks in workflows.  
2. **Build Solutions**: Leverage Python and tools like ChatGPT to automate processes and improve accuracy.  
3. **Deliver Results**: Create a solution that not only works for personal use but is also valuable to others, as demonstrated by its adoption and revenue generation.

Whether it‚Äôs saving time, reducing errors, or helping others streamline their workflows, this project underscores the power of combining technology with a problem-solving mindset.  

Feel free to explore the repository and adapt the scripts for your own workflows. While real data cannot be shared due to confidentiality, the included **sample data** demonstrates how the system works effectively.
